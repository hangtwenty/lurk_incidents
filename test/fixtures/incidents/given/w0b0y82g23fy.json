At that time, we routed all mail through another provider, resulting in emails being successfully delivered.\r\n\r\nWe understand these scenarios cause a lot of frustration and you rely on your notifications to be delivered in a timely manner. With this in mind, we'll continue to improve this in the future.\r\n\r\nWe're looking into how we can automate this failover in the future so when one of our mail providers is delayed, we route all mail through another mail provider.","created_at":"2016-09-07T11:01:35.777-07:00","wants_twitter_update":false,"twitter_updated_at":null,"updated_at":"2016-09-07T11:01:35.777-07:00","display_at":"2016-08-30T12:00:00.000-07:00","affected_components":[{"name":"No components were affected by this update."}],"id":"sj2bxd59t9fs","incident_id":"w0b0y82g23fy"}],"components":[]}
