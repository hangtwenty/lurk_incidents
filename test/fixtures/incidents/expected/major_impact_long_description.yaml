    Errant deploy causing site outage

    We had issues with some parts of our infrastructure starting after a deploy. We're working on a fix right now.

    After a deploy, upgrading a library, our web application failed to start. We pushed a fix and brought back our services. We will continue to monitor the service's health, but our services are all operational. Our public metrics are delayed as a result of the downtime.

    This incident has been resolved.

    This incident affected: Notifications (Email, Webhook, Twitter), Hosted Pages, API, Management Interface, Website, Third Party Components, Component Alert Parsing, Chat Integrations, and Public Metrics (Pingdom, New Relic, Librato, Datadog).
