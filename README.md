- currently I assume you are just cloing this repo then running `ruby main.rb` (I haven't packaged up as a real CLI script, since it feels like a one-off/niche util...)
- configuration is loaded from `$( pwd )/lurk_incidents.yaml`.
    - there's an example for you to start from, `lurk_incidents.yaml.example`
- test suite...
    - I wanted to be able to work with real fixtures for a reg suite of sorts, do this a bit test driven, see how that feels in ruby...
    - ... and I was fully ready to open the knives drawer in Ruby and play with some magic. being a Python programmer usually, this makes me feel so _edgy_ but I figured I'd give it a shot and see if I surprise myself ... hey maybe I'd like it?
    - so, that explains the cleverness in `test_incidents_fixtures.rb` ... which is, anyway, useful in the end. leaving the cleverness there so I can look back at it in a few months and see how I feel about it. a little test on myself. how much do I like the magic? :)
